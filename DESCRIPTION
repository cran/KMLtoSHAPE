Description: The developed function is designed to facilitate the seamless conversion of KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
             files to Shapefiles while preserving attribute values. It provides a straightforward interface for users
             to effortlessly import KML data, extract relevant attributes, and export them into the widely compatible
             Shapefile format. The package ensures accurate representation of spatial data while maintaining the integrity
             of associated attribute information. For details see, Flores, G. (2021). <DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-63665-4_15>.
             Whether for spatial analysis, visualization, or data interoperability, it simplifies the conversion process and 
             empowers users to seamlessly work with geospatial datasets.
